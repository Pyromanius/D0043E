# --------------ASSIGNMENT 3F----------------

# Concepts Covered: Custom functions, return, calling functions with parameters

# Description:

# Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

#     Define functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Multiplication should be performed without using *.
#     Ask the user to enter two numbers and the operation they want to perform.
#     Call the appropriate function and display the result.
#     If the user tries to divide by 0, display: "Error: Division by zero"
#     Use the prompts shown in the example interaction below.

# Example Interaction:

# Enter the first number: 10
# Enter the second number: 5
# Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
# The result of 10 * 5 is 50.
